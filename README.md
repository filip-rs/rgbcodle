## RGBcodle
This is a simple webgame I decided to code after getting inspired by Hexcodle.com. I thought it would be fun to put more focus on guessing the exact colour and less on translating it to hexadecimals so here we are.

All credit goes to Hexcodle and the original Wordle, this is just another spinoff I made for fun.
